# Codecademy-London-Bot
Bot for codecademy london chapter

This bot, managed by myself is a community project within the Codecademy London Chapter, with the aim to give members experience
in a project outside of courses. I have used my experience on the Gyoshin Raid Planner bot to lead this, set up the bot, assign
and assist with features, and provide help. 

### This bot is only for use inside Codecademy London Chapter, but functionality will include:

- Welcome message to provide information of the chapter.
- Allow members of the server to play games against the bot.
- Provide messages of encouragement/Jokes/Trvia on command.
- Allow setting of a timer to remind memmbers to take a break while studying (with option to pick time interval).
- Reminds members of an event/meeting 1 hour before it is set to begin.
- Keep studying resources in a database where members can access them. 
- Provide mental health resources.
- Maintain a lo-fi music channel to study in with other members. 
- Misc april fools gags / easter eggs.
